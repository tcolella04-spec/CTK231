                    <h3>Accelerated Creative Technologies Sequence</h3>
                    <p>High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion of their undergraduate degree. <br>
                       This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate program in Creative Technologies.<br> 
                       Students can then apply to the Creative Technologies graduate program in the spring of their senior year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final <br>
                       admission into the Creative Technologies graduate program. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, <br> 
                       visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors and the Creative Technologies Program advisor. </p>
